# Tetris-Game-in-Python-using-Pygame
This project is a classic implementation of the Tetris game developed using Python and the Pygame library. It features smooth gameplay mechanics, colorful tetrominoes, score tracking, line clearing logic, and a "next block" preview for better strategy planning. The game starts with a welcome screen and supports user controls for rotating, moving, and instantly dropping blocks. It includes all fundamental Tetris features like line removal, game over detection, and a scoring system based on the number of lines cleared. This project is a great demonstration of using object-oriented programming and Pygame for building interactive games.
